<h3>1.US Uniform Crimes</h3>

<p class="para">In 2012, 48 law enforcement officers died from injuries incurred in the line of duty.  FBI releases the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/leoka/2012/leoka-home" target="_blank">US Uniform Crime Report</a> every year, which offers statistics of those crime involvement, including officers feloniously killed, officers accidentally killed, officers assaulted, and federal officers killed and assaulted <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/leoka" target="_blank">from 1996 to 2012. </a></p>

<p class="para">This topic has not received enough attention from the media, as I had hard time to find related articles. I think these FBI reports are sort of meaningful, thus deserving more coverage.</p>

<p class="para">My project would be an interactive chart showing different aspects of those uniform crime cases across the US. The opening graphic could be a locator map showing the total numbers of the crimes across the US. As readers click through the graphic more details will show up, such as time of the crime, age of the officers, weapons, circumstances, etc.</p>

<p class="para">I want to learn D3 to execute the graphic by myself. I would probably need to know some mapping techniques to create the opening graphic. I have to combine multiple data files to analyze the data, therefore I have to learn how to better analyze data.</p>

<h3>2.Airline Performances and Flight Delay  </h3>

<p class="para">Many people concerns about NYC subway delays, but how about flight delays. I think it is interesting to explore US airline performances. </p>

<p class="para">I have find two great story about the similar topic, which is very inspiring to me. One is <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/guides/flightdelays/" target="_blank">Flight Delay Calculator</a>, and the other is a multimedia chart called <a href="http://content.time.com/time/interactive/0,31813,1653542,00.html" target="_blank">How to Eliminate Flight Delays</a>. I think I can find other interesting angles, but I have trouble to understand the data right now. </p>

<p class="para">I find a webpage with all the downloadable data from <a href="http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time" target="_blank">RITA On Time Performances</a>. The database has multiple categories, and I have to analyze the data to fine a storyline. I have not decided the format of this project. I think I will have a better idea after analyze the data. </p>

<p class="para">First of all, I have to learn to how to analyze this database. Data processing is an important skill i really need to improe. Often, a better story could be found by dissecting the data. Itâ€™s a rich database, so will need more time to find a story out there. Also, I think I need to learn D3, processing and more JavaScript to carry this out. </p>

<h3>3. Credit Card Complain </h3>

<p class="para">Have you complained your credit card? What are the top reasons people tend to complain their credit cards? The story will be an explainer to explore why people are complaining about their cards and how banks response. </p>

<p class="para">Federal Trade Commission issued a reported called <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/02/ftc-releases-top-10-complaint-categories-2012" target="_blank">Top 10 National Consumer Complains,</a>  in which identity thief ranks the first. Meanwhile <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/credit-card-complaints-cfpb-33751" target="_blank">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Consumer Complaint Database</a>  contains complaints received about financial products and services, including credit cards. It will be interesting to compare the two data at the same time. </p>

<p class="para">My project would be an interactive graphic with various types of charts, such as bar chart or nightingale chart. I want to practice D3 to create beautiful transition from chart to chart. I will be great if I could interview people who recently complained about their credit cards. </p>

<p class="para">I want to learn D3 to execute the graphic by myself. I would probably need to know some mapping techniques to create the opening graphic. I have to combine multiple data files to analyze the data, therefore I have to learn how to better analyze data.</p>
