<p id="hed">Consumer Complain in US</p>

<p class="para">Have you complained your credit card? What are the top reasons people tend to complain their consumption? What are the top financial products people complain more, and what are the deep reasons for those complains? How effective of those complains? </p>

<p class="para">Many people want to know more to solve their financial problems. Since the World Consumer Rights Day is coming soon, which is March 15, the topic will be newsworthy to some degree. The story will be an explainer to explore why people are complaining about their financial products and how the financial institutes response. </p>

<p class="para">Federal Trade Commission issued a reported called <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/02/ftc-releases-top-10-complaint-categories-2012" target="_blank">Top 10 National Consumer Complains,</a>  in which identity thief ranks the first. Meanwhile <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database" target="_blank">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Consumer Complaint Database</a>  contains complaints received about financial products and services. It will be interesting to compare the two dataset at the same time. </p>

<p class="para">My project would be a multi-chapter interactive graphic showing different part of consumer complain. For instance, graphics about complains by product, complains by reporting method, complains by company, or the top reasons for credit complains and top reasons for mortgage complains, etc. The format of the graphics could be various charts, nightingale, or diagrams. It will depend on the data analyze process. </p>

<p class="para">For the human resources, I think it would be interesting to interview several consumers who complained through Federal Trade Commission, and compare their experiences with the database. However, I think it will be hard t find them because those complains are anonymous actions. The second option is to interview someone from the Federal Trade Commission, which is less interesting. </p>

<p class="para">Still, I want to learn D3 skills and JavaScript skill to execute this project. Second, I have to combine multiple data files to analyze the data, therefore I have to learn how to better analyze rich database. Also, I have the geographic data, so I might need mapping techniques to create a heat map the show the regional difference. </p>

<p class="para">I want to pitch my idea to consumer magazine such as Consumer Voice or Consumer Rights. Or, maybe I can pitch my idea to some financial magazine such as Forbes, Business, or Money.  </p>
